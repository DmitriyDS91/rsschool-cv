## ABOUT ME

I am engaging in interpretation of oil and gas field surveys data now, but I would like to change the focus to IT.  I think this industry is more relevant, with interesting tasks and has more scope to improve skills.

I have no experience in front-end development. I have a good background, which I got in college. I am hardworking and ready to conquer new horizons.
